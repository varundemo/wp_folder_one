We only change your sending status in order to protect your reputation as a sender, and to ensure that other SES 
customers' ability to send email isn't impacted. We may pause your account's ability to send email so that you have time 
to address these issues. When you fix these issues, we'll restore your account's ability to send email.

We recently performed a manual review of your account&#39;s email-sending practices. During our review, we identified 
characteristics that could cause email providers or anti-spam organizations to classify your messages as spam.

The methods we use to make this decision are proprietary, so unfortunately we can&#39;t provide specific details. 
In general, we only perform manual reviews when our automated systems indicate that an account is sending unsolicited email.

Please review your email-sending practices and procedures to determine the causes of this issue. Common factors that 
could cause this issue include, but aren&#39;t limited to, the following:
- Messages that are flagged by commercial anti-spam filters
- Message content that implies that the recipient didn&#39;t explicitly ask to receive this type of message from you
- A mismatch between the branding in the messages and the sending email address
- Messages that contain content that&#39;s commonly associated with unsolicited sending
- Email-sending patterns that are associated with unsolicited sending
- Sending from or linking to domains that have poor reputations with online reputation monitoring systems
